5 awesome Javascript websites.

1. http://www.pikaboo.be/
It is a javabased website for an animation company.  I like the way the pictures are presented in the interactive slideshow.
2. http://baroque.me/
Awesome cello concerto made with javascript.  I like how creative it looks and sounds.
3. http://color.method.ac/
A fun color matching game made with javascript.  I spent an hour playing this the first time I saw it.
4. http://www.chromeweblab.com/
Awesome interactive hub with lots of people involved in silly experiments.  I spent an hour on this one as well when I first came across it.
5. http://currantcat.com/convergence/
Fun little javascript game about meeting two people in love.  It was a pretty easy game and enjoyable.

I would like to make something similar to an interactive website where people can go in and move things around.
However, what I think I can make would be silly moving pictures.
