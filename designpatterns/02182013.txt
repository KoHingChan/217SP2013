Constructor pattern: Creates objects with properties

Module: Private and Public object stuff.

Revealing Module: 

Singleton:  Enforces the creation of one and only one object (needs global scope because it needs to be aware that object doesn't exist in another place)

Observer: Observes and sends a message out.  It moves through lists and objects in order to see what happens where and reports it.

Mediator: 

PubSub: The way that most distributed system uses the publish/subscribed pattern in their system.  (i.e. dropbox, social network, etc.) There is a publisher and then the publisher has
subscribers and it does not know anything about its subscriber and it just pushes out information.  This is good to generalize different aspects into a general area to provide content for
anyone.

Facade Pattern:  simplestuff

Factory Pattern:  Pumps out objects.

Decorator Pattern: This makes stuff more useful.
