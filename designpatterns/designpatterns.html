<h4>What are Design Patterns?</h4>

<p>Design patterns are known solutions to common problems that most programmers may have while trying to create programs.  They also are structured in a way in which any programmer could look at it and know what function it serves and how the logic works.</p>

<h4>Each Design Pattern's Purpose</h4>
<p>The Creator Pattern makes objects once there is memory allocated to it.  This generally makes objects with properties assigned to it through the pattern.  Since everything in Javascript is an object, this is an important design pattern in order to add more objects with certain properties.</p>
<p>The Module Pattern makes private and public allocations of certain methods, variables, and object in order to keep everything neat and orderly.  This type of pattern moves existing items into certain discrete classes in order to reduce chances that certain functions have the same name even though they do different things.</p>
<p>The Revealing Module Pattern is the more improved version of the module pattern.  Heilmann did not like the fact that he had to repeat the names of the objects when he wanted to call a function using public variables or methods.  Also, the module pattern needed to always use object literal notation every time he wanted something public.  In the improved pattern, he set every function to private which would return anonymous object which uncovers the private functions which we want to make public.  This is used in place of the module pattern to ensure privacy but allow easier access to make certain things public.</p>
<p>The Singleton Pattern assigns a class strictly to only one object.  </p>
<p>There is a factory pattern going on in the console.</p>
<p>A programmer makes a script to write "Hello, World." into the document.</p>
<p>When it runs, it returns, "Who's there?"</p>
<script src="factory1.js"></script>
